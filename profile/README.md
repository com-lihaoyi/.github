## The com-lihaoyi Scala Ecosystem ðŸ‘‹

The `com-lihaoyi` Scala ecosystem lets you write Scala in an easy and productive way
while delivering real business value. It provides all the core building blocks a
typical software engineer needs day to day: HTTP clients and servers, data serialization,
filesystem operations, CLI argument parsing, build tooling, etc. These can be combined in
a variety of ways to perform many useful real-world tasks:

- Build a website or API server with [Cask](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/cask),
  [ScalaSql](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalasql), and
  [Scalatags](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalatags) ([Example](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/cask/blob/master/example/todo/app/src/TodoServer.scala))

- Write a command-line utility with [MainArgs](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mainargs) and
  [OS-Lib](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib) 

- Automate some third-party JSON APIs via [Requests-Scala](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala)
  and [uPickle](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/upickle) ([Example](https://github.com/handsonscala/handsonscala/tree/v1/examples/12.1%20-%20IssueMigrator))

- Build and test an existing Scala project more quickly and interactively with the
  [Mill Build Tool](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill) or the [Ammonite REPL](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/Ammonite)

The `com-lihaoyi` ecosystem is all open source, but if you want to learn more about writing
Scala in the easy and productive way, you check out the following book:
