## The lihaoyi Scala Platform ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬

The `lihaoyi` platform lets you write Scala in an easy and productive way
while delivering real business value. It provides all the core building blocks a
typical software engineer needs day to day: HTTP clients and servers, JSON/binary data serialization,
filesystem operations, CLI argument parsing, build tooling, etc. These can be combined in
a variety of ways to perform many useful real-world tasks:

- Build a website with [Cask](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/cask),
  [ScalaSql](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalasql), and
  [Scalatags](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalatags) ([Example](https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/cask/#todomvc-full-stack-web)) or API server with [Cask](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/cask),
  [ScalaSql](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalasql), and
  [uPickle](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/upickle) ([Example](https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/cask/#todomvc-database-integration)) 

- Write a command-line utility with [MainArgs](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mainargs) and
  [OS-Lib](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib)  ([Examples](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib?tab=readme-ov-file#cookbook))

- Automate some third-party JSON APIs via [Requests-Scala](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala)
  and [uPickle](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/upickle) ([Example](https://github.com/handsonscala/handsonscala/tree/v1/examples/12.1%20-%20IssueMigrator))

- Write an incremental static site generator using the [Mill Build Tool](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill),
  together with [OS-Lib](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib) and [Scalatags](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/scalatags)
  ([Example](https://mill-build.com/mill/Cross_Builds.html#_use_case_static_blog))
